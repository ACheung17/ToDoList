# ToDoList
A To-Do List Application that allows user to add and delete a checklist of items. 
Different lists can be generated by adding a slash (/) followed by the name of your list at the end of the URL.

This app handles the back-end through Node.js and utilizes MongoDB as the database to store user data. In addition, the code simplified further using Express.js and Mongoose. 

To use the source code for you own project, replace admin user and password in the connect portion in app.js to your won database credentials.
